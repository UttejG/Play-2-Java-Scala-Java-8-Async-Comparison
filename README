TODO:  remove throws Throwable from anonymous inner functions


This project started out as an exercise in understanding the sample code in Jim {last name here}'s
blog post {name of blog post here}.

The post's sample code is all written in Scala and, while that's all well and good & I do love me
 some Scala, the Play 2 projects I'll be working on will be written primarily in Java, at least
 for the short term.

 Scala =  99 LOC (excluding package & imports)

 This being the case, I started writing JavaController which implements _all of the same
 functionality_. Prior to Java 8, the language has no functional constructs whatsoever. I took a
 stab at writing some building up some "functional adapters." They get the job done & are pretty
 well generalized for this exercise. I don't know if I'd want to live with them, but I think they
 might help to illustrate the amount of code reuse that can be accomplished with a functional style.

 Java = 185 LOC, 167 if you exclude the `map` and `flatMap` adapters.
 166; 148 w/out imports & package

 Then along comes Java 8.

 96 LOC
